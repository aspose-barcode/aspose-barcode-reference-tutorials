## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.BarCode for Java, a powerful tool that empowers developers to decode and read various 1D barcodes effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will dive into the process of getting all possible 1D barcodes from an image using Aspose.BarCode for Java. By the end of this guide, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage this Java library for barcode recognition.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this coding journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download the library from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

Now that you have the necessary tools, let's jump into the coding arena.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java project, include the required namespaces to access the functionality of Aspose.BarCode for Java.

```java
import java.awt.Point;

import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;
import com.aspose.barcode.examples.ApplyALicense;
import com.aspose.barcode.examples.Utils;
```

## Step 1: Initialize BarCodeReader Object

Begin by initializing the `BarCodeReader` object. This object is crucial for reading barcodes from the provided image.

```java
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader("path/to/your/image.png", DecodeType.CODE_128);
```

## Step 2: Read All Possible Barcodes

Now, let's extract all possible barcodes from the image.

```java
int iCount = 0;
for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
    // Display code text, symbology, detected angle, recognition percentage of the barcode
    System.out.println("Code Text: " + result.getCodeText() + " Symbology: " + result.getCodeTypeName()
            + " Recognition percentage: " + result.getRegion().getAngle());

    // Display x and y coordinates of barcode detected
    Point[] point = result.getRegion().getPoints();

    System.out.println("Top left coordinates: X = " + point[0].getX() + ", Y = " + point[0].getY());
    System.out.println("Bottom left coordinates: X = " + point[1].getX() + ", Y = " + point[1].getY());
    System.out.println("Bottom right coordinates: X = " + point[2].getX() + ", Y = " + point[2].getY());
    System.out.println("Top right coordinates: X = " + point[3].getX() + ", Y = " + point[3].getY());

    iCount = iCount + 1;
}
```

Repeat these steps for each barcode found in the image.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully explored the process of getting all possible 1D barcodes from an image using Aspose.BarCode for Java. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for barcode recognition in your Java applications.
