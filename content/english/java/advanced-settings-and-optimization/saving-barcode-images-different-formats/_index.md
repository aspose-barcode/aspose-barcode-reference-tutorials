## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of Java development, creating and managing barcode images efficiently is a crucial aspect of various applications. Aspose.BarCode for Java is a powerful library that simplifies the process of barcode generation, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate barcode functionality into their projects.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment with JDK installed.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a Java IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ for coding.

## Import Namespaces

To kickstart the barcode generation process, import the necessary namespaces in your Java class:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.barcode.*;

import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory Path

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Instantiate Barcode Object

```java
// Instantiate barcode object, Set the symbology type to code128 and Set the
// Code text for the barcode
BarcodeGenerator bb = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "1234567");
```

Create a BarcodeGenerator object and set the symbology type to CODE_128. Additionally, set the desired code text for the barcode.

## Step 3: Save Barcode Image in JPEG Format

```java
// Save the image to your system and set its image format to Jpeg
bb.save(dataDir + "barcode-image-format.jpg", BarCodeImageFormat.JPEG);
```

Save the generated barcode image to your system with the specified filename and image format (in this case, JPEG).

Repeat these steps for other image formats like PNG, GIF, or TIFF by changing the `BarCodeImageFormat` accordingly.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to generate barcode images in different formats using Aspose.BarCode for Java. This versatile library opens up a world of possibilities for developers seeking an efficient and reliable solution for barcode integration.
