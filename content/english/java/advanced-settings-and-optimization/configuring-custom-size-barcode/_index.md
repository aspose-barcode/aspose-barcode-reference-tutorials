## Introduction

If you're a Java developer looking to configuring custom sized barcodes seamlessly, Aspose.BarCode for Java is your go-to solution. This tutorial will walk you through the process of configuring a custom size for your barcodes, ensuring flexibility and precision in your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- A working Java development environment.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

## Import Namespaces

Ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported in your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.AutoSizeMode;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
import com.aspose.barcode.examples.Utils;
```

## Step 1: Set the Path to the Resource Directory

Begin by specifying the path to your resource directory:

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Instantiate Barcode Object

Create an instance of the BarcodeGenerator class and set the code text and symbology type. In this example, we use Code39Standard:

```java
// Instantiate barcode object, Set the Code text for the barcode and the
// symbology type to Code39Standard
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODE_39_STANDARD,
		"1234567890");
```

## Step 3: Disable Auto Size

Turn off auto sizing to manually set the dimensions:

```java
// Set auto size false
generator.getParameters().setAutoSizeMode(AutoSizeMode.NEAREST);
```

## Step 4: Set Height

Specify the height of the barcode in millimeters:

```java
// Set height
generator.getParameters().getImageHeight().setMillimeters(50);
```

## Step 5: Set Width

Define the width of the barcode in millimeters:

```java
// Set width
generator.getParameters().getImageWidth().setMillimeters(120);
```

## Step 6: Save the Image

Save the generated barcode image to your specified directory:

```java
// Save the image
generator.save(dataDir + "barcode-custom-size.jpg");
```

Congratulations! You've successfully configured a custom size for your barcode using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the essential steps to configuring a custom sized barcode in Java using Aspose.BarCode. By following these straightforward steps, you can seamlessly integrate barcode functionality into your Java applications with precision and ease.
