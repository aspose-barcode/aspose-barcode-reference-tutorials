## Introduction

Creating barcodes in Java has never been easier, thanks to the powerful Aspose.BarCode for Java library. Whether you're working on inventory management, document tracking, or any application requiring barcodes, this tutorial will guide you through the process step by step. In this tutorial, we'll focus on setting code text using Aspose.BarCode, a versatile and efficient barcode generation tool.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following in place:

- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- A working Java development environment installed.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).
- A code editor, such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages are essential for working with Aspose.BarCode.

```java
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;

```

Now, let's explore the process of setting code text using Aspose.BarCode in Java. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create an Instance of BarcodeGenerator

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String path = "Your Directory Path";
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "12345678");
```

Here, we create a `BarcodeGenerator` instance, specifying the barcode symbology (CODE_128) and the code text ("12345678").

## Step 2: Set the Width of the Bars

```java
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().getXDimension().setMillimeters(0.5f);
```

Adjust the width of the bars to your preference. In this example, we set it to 0.5 millimeters.

## Step 3: Save the Barcode Image

```java
generator.save(dataDir + "setCodeText.jpg");
```

Save the generated barcode image to the specified directory. In this case, it's saved as "setCodeText.jpg" in the "Your Document Directory."

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a barcode with custom code text using Aspose.BarCode for Java. This powerful library simplifies the barcode generation process, making it a valuable tool for Java developers.
