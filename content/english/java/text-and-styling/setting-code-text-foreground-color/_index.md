## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, incorporating robust barcode functionality into your Java applications is crucial. Aspose.BarCode for Java provides a seamless solution, allowing developers to generate, recognize, and manipulate barcodes with ease. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific aspect of barcode customization: setting the code text foreground color.

## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this coding journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.BarCode for Java requires a compatible JDK installed on your system. You can download the latest JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Aspose.BarCode for Java Library: Obtain the Aspose.BarCode for Java library by visiting the [official download page](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/). Follow the installation instructions to integrate it into your Java project.

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a Java IDE of your preference, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans.

## Import Packages
Once you have set up your development environment, it's time to import the necessary packages to kickstart your barcode customization. In your Java project, add the following import statements:

```java
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
import java.awt.Color;
```

## Step 1: Specify Directories
Begin by defining the paths to your document and resource directories. This is crucial for saving the generated barcode image to the correct location.

```java
String path = "Your Directory Path";
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create BarcodeGenerator Instance
Instantiate a `BarcodeGenerator` object, specifying the barcode symbology (in this case, CODE_128) and the code text you want to encode.

```java
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "12345678");
```

## Step 3: Set Code Text Color
Configure the code text color by accessing the barcode parameters and setting the desired color. In this example, we've chosen red.

```java
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().getCodeTextParameters().setColor(Color.RED);
```

## Step 4: Save the Barcode Image
Save the customized barcode image to your specified directory.

```java
generator.save(dataDir + "codeTextForegroundColor.jpg");
```

Congratulations! You've successfully customized the code text foreground color in your Java barcode using Aspose.BarCode.
