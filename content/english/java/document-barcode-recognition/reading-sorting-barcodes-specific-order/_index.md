## Introduction

In the dynamic world of Java programming, efficiently handling barcodes is a common requirement for many applications. Aspose.BarCode for Java emerges as a powerful tool, offering seamless integration for barcode reading and sorting. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to read and sort barcodes in a specific order using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.BarCode for Java requires a functioning JDK. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Aspose.BarCode Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.BarCode library. You can obtain it from the official [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages provide the essential classes and methods for working with barcodes.

```java
// Import Aspose.BarCode classes
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;

import java.awt.Point;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

Now, let's break down the code into a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Set up the Resource Directory

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

### Step 2: Specify Barcode Image Path and Initialize Reader

```java
String path = dataDir + "barcode.png";
List<FoundBarCodes> found = new ArrayList<FoundBarCodes>();

// Initialize BarCodeReader with the specified path and decode type
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(path, DecodeType.CODE_128);
```

### Step 3: Read Barcodes and Store Results

```java
// Iterate through barcodes and store results
for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
    found.add(new FoundBarCodes(result.getCodeText(), result.getRegion()));
}
```

### Step 4: Define Comparator for Sorting

```java
// Define a comparator for sorting barcodes based on code text
Comparator<FoundBarCodes> foundComparator = new Comparator<FoundBarCodes>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(FoundBarCodes e1, FoundBarCodes e2) {
        return e1.getCodeText().compareTo(e2.getCodeText());
    }
};
```

### Step 5: Sort Barcodes

```java
// Sort the list of barcodes using the defined comparator
found.sort(foundComparator);
```

### Step 6: Display Sorted Barcodes

```java
// Display sorted barcodes with their coordinates
int i = 1;
for (FoundBarCodes barcode : found) {
    Point[] point = barcode.BarCodeRegion.getPoints();
    System.out.println("Codetext ( " + i + " ): " + barcode.CodeText);
    System.out.println("Top left coordinates: X = " + point[0].getX() + ", Y = " + point[0].getY());
    System.out.println("Bottom left coordinates: X = " + point[1].getX() + ", Y = " + point[1].getY());
    System.out.println("Bottom right coordinates: X = " + point[2].getX() + ", Y = " + point[2].getY());
    System.out.println("Top right coordinates: X = " + point[3].getX() + ", Y = " + point[3].getY());
    System.out.println();
    i++;
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to leverage Aspose.BarCode for Java to read and sort barcodes in a specific order. By following the step-by-step guide, you can enhance your Java applications with efficient barcode processing capabilities.
