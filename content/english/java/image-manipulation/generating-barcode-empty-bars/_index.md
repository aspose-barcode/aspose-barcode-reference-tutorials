## Introduction

In the dynamic world of software development, integrating barcode generation capabilities into Java applications has become a common requirement. Aspose.BarCode for Java stands out as a robust solution, providing developers with a powerful set of tools for creating various types of barcodes. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of generating a barcode with empty bars using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on the barcode generation journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

2. Aspose.BarCode for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode for Java library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

3. Document Directory: Create a directory on your system to store the generated barcode image.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages for working with Aspose.BarCode:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.barcode.BarCodeImageFormat;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Resource Directory

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Create Barcode Generator Instance

```java
// Create an instance of BarcodeGenerator and initialize it with CodeText and Symbology
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "TEXT");
```

Here, we're creating a BarcodeGenerator instance with CODE_128 symbology and the text "TEXT" as the code to be encoded.

## Step 3: Set FilledBars Property to False

```java
// Set the FilledBars property to false
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().setFilledBars(false);
```

By setting `FilledBars` to `false`, we ensure that the generated barcode will have empty bars.

## Step 4: Save the Barcode Image

```java
// Save the resultant barcode image on disk
generator.save(dataDir + "barcodeWithEmptyBars.png", BarCodeImageFormat.PNG);
```

This step involves saving the generated barcode image to the specified directory in PNG format.

Repeat these steps in your Java application to effortlessly generate a barcode with empty bars using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Conclusion
