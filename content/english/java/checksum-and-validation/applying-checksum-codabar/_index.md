## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on applying checksum for CodaBar in Java using Aspose.BarCode. Aspose.BarCode for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to generate and recognize barcodes in Java applications seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will focus on the specific task of applying checksum for CodaBar barcodes.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).
- A basic understanding of Java programming.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, make sure to import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.BarCode:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.barcode.CodabarChecksumMode;
import com.aspose.barcode.EnableChecksum;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.ChecksumValidation;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Start by creating a new Java project and including the Aspose.BarCode library in your project's dependencies. Set up your development environment with the required resources.

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Generation of CodaBar Barcode

Now, let's generate a CodaBar barcode with checksum enabled.

```java
// Instantiate BarcodeGenerator object
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODABAR, "1234567890");

// Set the EnableChecksum property to yes
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().setChecksumEnabled(EnableChecksum.YES);

// Set the CodabarChecksumMode
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().getCodabar().setCodabarChecksumMode(CodabarChecksumMode.MOD_10);

// Save the image on the system
generator.save(dataDir + "Codabar_Mod10.png");
```

## Step 3: Recognition of CodaBar Barcode

Now, let's implement the recognition part of the CodaBar barcode with checksum.

```java
// Initialize reader object
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(dataDir + "Codabar_Mod10.png", DecodeType.CODABAR);

// Set ChecksumValidation property of the reader to On
reader.setChecksumValidation(ChecksumValidation.ON);

for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
    System.out.println("CodeText: " + result.getCodeText());
    System.out.println("Symbology type: " + result.getCodeType());

    // Get checksum value
    System.out.println("Checksum:" + result.getExtended().getOneD().getCheckSum());
}
```

Follow these steps to apply checksum for CodaBar in Java effortlessly using Aspose.BarCode.
