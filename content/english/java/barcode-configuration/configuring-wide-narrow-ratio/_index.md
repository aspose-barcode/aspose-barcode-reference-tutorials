# Configuring Wide-Narrow Ratio in Java with Aspose.BarCode

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on configuring the wide-narrow ratio in Java using Aspose.BarCode. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up the wide to narrow ratio for a barcode using Aspose.BarCode for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with barcode generation, this guide will help you achieve the desired configuration with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. This includes the Aspose.BarCode library, which provides the tools and functionality needed for barcode generation.

```java
// Import Aspose.BarCode library
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Example Breakdown

Let's break down the example code into multiple steps to understand each part of the process.

### Step 1: Set Document Directory

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure you set the path to the directory where you want to save the generated barcode image.

### Step 2: Instantiate Barcode Object

```java
// Instantiate barcode object
// Create an instance of BarcodeGenerator, specify codetext and symbology in the constructor
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "12345678");
```

Create a BarcodeGenerator object and specify the codetext and symbology (CODE_128 in this case) for the barcode.

### Step 3: Set Wide-Narrow Ratio

```java
// Set the wide to narrow ratio for the barcode
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().setWideNarrowRatio(3.0f);
```

Use the setWideNarrowRatio method to configure the wide to narrow ratio for the barcode. Adjust the ratio according to your requirements.

### Step 4: Save Image to Disk

```java
// Save the image to disk in PNG format
generator.save(dataDir + "wideNarrowRatio.png");
```

Save the generated barcode image to the specified directory with the configured wide-narrow ratio.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully configured the wide-narrow ratio for a barcode in Java using Aspose.BarCode. This customization allows you to create barcodes tailored to your specific needs.
