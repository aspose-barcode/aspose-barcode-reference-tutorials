## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on setting start and stop symbols using Aspose.BarCode for Java! In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of generating barcodes with specific start and stop symbols using Aspose.BarCode's powerful Java library. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will equip you with the knowledge to efficiently utilize Aspose.BarCode for your barcode generation needs.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.BarCode for Java requires a working Java environment. Install the latest version of JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. Aspose.BarCode for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let's proceed with the tutorial.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to use Aspose.BarCode:

```java
// Import Aspose.BarCode classes
import com.aspose.barcode.CodabarSymbol;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for a clearer understanding:

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your project directory.

## Step 2: Create Barcode Generator Instance

```java
// Create instance of BarcodeGenerator, specify codetext and symbology in the constructor
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODABAR, "12345678");
```

Instantiate a `BarcodeGenerator` object with the desired symbology (in this case, CODABAR) and codetext ("12345678").

## Step 3: Set Codabar Start Symbol

```java
// Set the Codabar start symbol to A
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().getCodabar().setCodabarStartSymbol(CodabarSymbol.A);
```

Use the `setCodabarStartSymbol` method to set the Codabar start symbol. In this example, we set it to 'A'.

## Step 4: Set Codabar Stop Symbol

```java
// Set the Codabar stop symbol to D
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().getCodabar().setCodabarStopSymbol(CodabarSymbol.D);
```

Similarly, use the `setCodabarStopSymbol` method to set the Codabar stop symbol. Here, we set it to 'D'.

## Step 5: Save the Generated Image

```java
// Save the image to disk in PNG format
generator.save(dataDir + "startAndStopSymbols.png");
```

Save the generated barcode image to the specified directory (`dataDir`) with the filename "startAndStopSymbols.png".

Repeat these steps for seamless integration of start and stop symbols into your barcode generation process.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to set start and stop symbols for Codabar barcodes using Aspose.BarCode for Java. This capability adds a layer of customization to your barcode generation, enhancing the flexibility of your applications.
