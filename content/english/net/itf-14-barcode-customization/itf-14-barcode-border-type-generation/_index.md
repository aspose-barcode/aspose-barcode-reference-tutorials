In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of generating ITF-14 barcodes with different border types using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. Aspose.BarCode is a powerful library that allows you to create, manipulate, and recognize barcodes in various formats. In this specific example, we will focus on ITF-14 barcodes and how to control their border types. ITF-14 barcodes are commonly used for packaging and labeling purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the barcode generation process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.BarCode for .NET: You need to have Aspose.BarCode for .NET installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).

2. Development Environment: Make sure you have a development environment set up, which can be a .NET project in your preferred IDE.

3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial for this tutorial.

4. Your Directory Path: Replace `"Your Directory Path"` in the code with the actual path where you want to save the generated barcode images.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.BarCode:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode;
```

## Step 1: Create an Instance of BarcodeGenerator

The first step is to create an instance of `BarcodeGenerator` for ITF-14 barcodes. You also need to specify the data to be encoded, in this case, "12345678901231".

```csharp
BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.ITF14, "12345678901231");
```

## Step 2: Set X-Dimension for Barcode

The X-Dimension represents the width of the barcode bars. You can set the X-Dimension in pixels as follows:

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Pixels = 2;
```

## Step 3: Generate ITF-14 Barcodes with Different Border Types

Aspose.BarCode allows you to choose from several border types for ITF-14 barcodes. We will generate barcodes for each of these types:

### ITF Border Type: None

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ITF.ItfBorderType = ITF14BorderType.None;
gen.Save($"{path}ITF14BorderNone.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

### ITF Border Type: Bar

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ITF.ItfBorderType = ITF14BorderType.Bar;
gen.Save($"{path}ITF14BorderBar.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

### ITF Border Type: BarOut

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ITF.ItfBorderType = ITF14BorderType.BarOut;
gen.Save($"{path}ITF14BorderBarOut.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

### ITF Border Type: Frame

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ITF.ItfBorderType = ITF14BorderType.Frame;
gen.Save($"{path}ITF14BorderFrame.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

### ITF Border Type: FrameOut

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ITF.ItfBorderType = ITF14BorderType.FrameOut;
gen.Save($"{path}ITF14BorderFrameOut.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to generate ITF-14 barcodes with different border types using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. By following the steps provided, you can create customized barcodes for your packaging and labeling needs.

Aspose.BarCode for .NET offers a wide range of features and customization options for barcode generation, making it a valuable tool for developers in various industries.
