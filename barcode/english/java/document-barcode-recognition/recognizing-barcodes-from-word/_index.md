# Effortless Barcode Recognition from Word Documents


## Introduction

In the dynamic world of Java programming, the need to work with barcodes efficiently is ever-growing. Recognizing barcodes from Word documents is a common requirement, and fortunately, Aspose.BarCode for Java provides a robust solution. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of recognizing barcodes from Word documents using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.BarCode for Java requires a Java development environment. Make sure you have the latest JDK installed on your system.

- Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode for Java library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, to follow along with the examples.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.BarCode packages to get started:

```java
import java.text.MessageFormat;

import com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
import com.aspose.words.ImageType;
import com.aspose.words.NodeCollection;
import com.aspose.words.NodeType;
```

## Step 1: Generate Barcode Image

Firstly, create a barcode image using Aspose.BarCode. Set the code text and save the image:

```java
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_39_STANDARD);
generator.setCodeText("test-123");
String strBarCodeImageSave = dataDir + "img.jpg";
generator.save(strBarCodeImageSave);
```

## Step 2: Add Image to Word Document

Now, insert the generated barcode image into a Word document using Aspose.Words:

```java
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder docBuilder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
docBuilder.insertImage(strBarCodeImageSave);
String strWordFile = "docout.doc";
doc.save(dataDir + strWordFile);
```

## Step 3: Recognize Barcodes from Word Document

Next, extract images from the Word document and recognize barcodes using Aspose.BarCode:

```java
NodeCollection<Shape> shapes = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.SHAPE, true);
int imageIndex = 0;

for (Shape shape : shapes) {
    if (shape.hasImage()) {
        // Extract image to file
        String extension = ImageTypeToExtension(shape.getImageData().getImageType());
        String imageFileName = MessageFormat.format("Image.ExportImages.{0} Out.{1}", imageIndex, extension);
        String strBarCodeImageExtracted = "" + imageFileName;
        shape.getImageData().save(strBarCodeImageExtracted);

        // Recognize barcode from this image
        BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(strBarCodeImageSave, DecodeType.CODE_39_STANDARD);
        for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
            System.out.println("CodeText: " + result.getCodeText());
            System.out.println("Symbology type: " + result.getCodeType());
        }
        imageIndex++;
    }
}
```

Repeat these steps, and you'll successfully recognize barcodes from Word documents using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, leveraging Aspose.BarCode for Java simplifies the process of recognizing barcodes from Word documents. Follow the steps outlined above, and you'll seamlessly integrate barcode recognition into your Java applications.
