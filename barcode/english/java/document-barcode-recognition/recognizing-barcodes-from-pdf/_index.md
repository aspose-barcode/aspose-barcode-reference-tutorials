# Recognizing Barcodes from PDF in Java


## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on recognizing barcodes from PDFs using Aspose.BarCode for Java. Barcodes play a crucial role in data management and organization, and with Aspose.BarCode, the process becomes seamless. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the entire process, from setting up the necessary prerequisites to implementing the code for barcode recognition in a PDF file.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.BarCode for Java License: Obtain and set up a valid license for Aspose.BarCode for Java. You can acquire a license from [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

2. Aspose.PDF License: Additionally, set up a license for Aspose.PDF, which is required for working with PDF files. You can apply for a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

3. Download Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download the Aspose.BarCode library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

Now that you have the necessary prerequisites, let's proceed to import the required packages and begin our tutorial.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, include the Aspose.BarCode and Aspose.PDF packages. Here's a sample code snippet to get you started:

```java
import com.aspose.barcode.*;
import com.aspose.barcode.License;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BaseDecodeType;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;
import com.aspose.pdf.*;
import com.aspose.pdf.facades.PdfExtractor;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
```

## Step 1: Generate Barcode and Add to PDF

```java
BarcodeGenerator builder = new BarcodeGenerator(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODE_39_STANDARD);
builder.setCodeText("test123");
String strBarCodeImageSave = dataDir + "input_image1.jpg";
builder.save(strBarCodeImageSave);
```

## Step 2: Create PDF and Add Barcode Image

```java
Document pdf1 = new Document();
Page page = pdf1.getPages().add();
BufferedImage originalImage = ImageIO.read(new File(strBarCodeImageSave));
page.getResources().getImages().add(originalImage);
pdf1.save(strPdfDoc);
```

## Step 3: Extract Images from PDF

```java
PdfExtractor extractor = new PdfExtractor();
extractor.bindPdf(strPdfDoc);
extractor.extractImage();
```

## Step 4: Recognize Barcode from Extracted Images

```java
String suffix = ".jpg";
int imageCount = 1;

while (extractor.hasNextImage()) {
    System.out.println("Extracting image " + imageCount);
    strBarCodeImage = "tmpbarcode" + imageCount + suffix;
    extractor.getNextImage(strBarCodeImage);

    BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(strBarCodeImage, DecodeType.CODE_39_EXTENDED);

    for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
        System.out.println("CodeText: " + result.getCodeText());
        System.out.println("Symbology type: " + result.getCodeType());
    }

    imageCount++;
}
```

Repeat these steps as needed, adjusting filenames and paths accordingly.
