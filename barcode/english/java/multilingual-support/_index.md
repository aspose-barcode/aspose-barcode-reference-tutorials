## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I parse PDF417 barcodes that contain mixed languages?**  
A: Yes. Aspose.BarCode automatically detects and decodes mixed‑language content in a single barcode.

**Q: Do I need to specify the language before parsing?**  
A: No. The API performs language detection internally, so you can simply call the decode method.

**Q: Is there a limit to the amount of data a PDF417 barcode can hold?**  
A: PDF417 can store up to about 1,850 characters; however, practical limits depend on the scanner resolution and image quality.

**Q: How do I handle password‑protected PDF files that contain PDF417 barcodes?**  
A: Load the PDF with the appropriate password using `BarCodeReader` constructors that accept a password parameter.

**Q: Does Aspose.BarCode support real‑time scanning from a camera feed?**  
A: Yes. Combine the API with a Java camera library (e.g., OpenCV) to capture frames and parse PDF417 on the fly.
