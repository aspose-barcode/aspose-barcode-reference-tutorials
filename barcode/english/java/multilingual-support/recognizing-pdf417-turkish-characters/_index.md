# Recognizing PDF417 Barcode with Turkish Characters in Java


## Introduction

Barcodes are an essential part of modern business operations, providing a streamlined way to manage and track data. Aspose.BarCode for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to work with barcodes seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of recognizing PDF417 barcodes with Turkish characters using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.BarCode for Java Library: Download and set up the Aspose.BarCode for Java library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

## Import Packages

In your Java project, include the necessary packages for working with Aspose.BarCode:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.charset.Charset;

import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new Java project and include the Aspose.BarCode library. If you haven't downloaded it yet, visit [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/) for the download.

## Step 2: Load Barcode Image

Define the path to your resource directory and load the barcode image:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(dataDir + "barcode.png", DecodeType.PDF_417);
```

## Step 3: Read Barcode

Use the BarCodeReader to read the barcode:

```java
for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
    byte[] bytes = result.getCodeBytes();
    ByteBuffer bytebuf = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes);
    System.out.println(Charset.forName("windows-1254").decode(bytebuf).toString());
}
```

This code snippet reads the PDF417 barcode and decodes the byte array to display Turkish characters.

## Conclusion

With Aspose.BarCode for Java, recognizing PDF417 barcodes with Turkish characters becomes a straightforward process. The steps outlined above guide you through the integration of the library into your Java project, loading the barcode image, and reading the barcode content.
