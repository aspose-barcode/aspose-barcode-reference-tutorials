# Always Showing Checksum in Java


## Introduction

In the dynamic world of Java programming, creating and managing barcodes is a common yet critical task. Aspose.BarCode for Java comes to the rescue with its powerful features and intuitive functionalities. One particularly useful feature is the ability to always show the checksum in generated barcodes. This ensures data integrity and reliability. In this guide, we'll delve into the step-by-step process of implementing this functionality using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on our barcode adventure, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ, for a seamless coding experience.

Now that we have our essentials covered, let's dive into the implementation.

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages lay the foundation for utilizing Aspose.BarCode for Java.

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory

Define the path to your resource directory where you want to store the generated barcode image.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Barcode Generator

Initialize the `BarcodeGenerator` object with the desired barcode type (here, CODE_128) and the data to be encoded (in this case, "12345").

```java
BarcodeGenerator generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "12345");
```

## Step 3: Enable Checksum Always Show

Activate the "Always Show Checksum" feature for the barcode by accessing the barcode parameters.

```java
generator.getParameters().getBarcode().setChecksumAlwaysShow(true);
```

## Step 4: Save the Barcode Image

Save the generated barcode image to the specified directory.

```java
generator.save(dataDir + "checksum.jpg");
```

With these simple steps, you've successfully configured Aspose.BarCode to always display the checksum in the generated barcode.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the seamless process of ensuring the display of checksum in Java barcodes using Aspose.BarCode. This feature adds an extra layer of data validation to your applications, enhancing the overall reliability of your barcode solutions.
