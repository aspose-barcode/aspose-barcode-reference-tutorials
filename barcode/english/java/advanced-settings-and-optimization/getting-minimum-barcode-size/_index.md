# Getting Minimum BarCode Size in Java with Aspose.BarCode

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on getting the minimum BarCode size in Java using Aspose.BarCode. If you're looking to optimize your BarCode images for space efficiency or specific display requirements, this tutorial is for you. Aspose.BarCode for Java provides a powerful set of features, and in this tutorial, we'll focus on customizing the size of your BarCode to the minimum.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Aspose.BarCode for Java: Download and install Aspose.BarCode for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

Now, let's jump into the coding part.

## Import Namespaces

In your Java code, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```java

import com.aspose.barcode.generation.AutoSizeMode;
import com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarcodeGenerator;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Barcode Generator

Create an instance of the `BarcodeGenerator` class, set the symbology type to CODE_128, and define the BarCode text:

```java
BarcodeGenerator bb = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.CODE_128, "1234567");
```

## Step 2: Disable AutoSizeMode

To customize the size, disable the auto-sizing mode:

```java
bb.getParameters().setAutoSizeMode(AutoSizeMode.NONE);
```

## Step 3: Set Image Height and Width to Minimum

Adjust the image dimensions to the minimum required:

```java
bb.getParameters().getImageWidth().setMillimeters(1);
bb.getParameters().getImageHeight().setMillimeters(1);
```

## Step 4: Save the Barcode Image

Generate the BarCode image and save it to a file:

```java
javax.imageio.ImageIO.write(bb.generateBarCodeImage(), "PNG", new java.io.File(dataDir + "minimumresult.png"));
```

Repeat these steps for each BarCode you want to customize.

Now you have successfully created a minimal-sized BarCode using Aspose.BarCode for Java.
