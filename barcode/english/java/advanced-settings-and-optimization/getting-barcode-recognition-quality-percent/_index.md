# Getting Barcode Recognition Quality in Percent in Java with Aspose.BarCode

## Introduction

If you're looking to getting the barcode recognition quality of your Java application, Aspose.BarCode is the perfect tool for the job. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of achieving optimal barcode recognition quality in a few simple steps using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

- Aspose.BarCode Library: Download and install the Aspose.BarCode library for Java. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/java/).

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

In this step, you'll import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.BarCode in your Java application.

```java
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeReader;
import com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.BarCodeResult;


```

Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps to guide you through the process of getting barcode recognition quality in percent using Aspose.BarCode for Java.

## Step 1: Set the Resource Directory Path

```java
// The path to the resource directory.
String dataDir = Utils.getDataDir(GetBarCodeRecognitionQualityInPercent.class)
		+ "BarcodeReader/advanced_features/";
```

## Step 2: Initialize BarCodeReader Object

```java
// Initialize the BarCodeReader object
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader(dataDir + "code39Extended.jpg",
		com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType.ALL_SUPPORTED_TYPES);
```

## Step 3: Call the Read Method

```java
// Call the read method
for (BarCodeResult result : reader.readBarCodes()) {
	System.out.println(result.getCodeText() + " Type: " + result.getCodeType());
	double percent = result.getReadingQuality();
	System.out.println("Percent: " + percent);
}
```

By following these steps, you can easily integrate Aspose.BarCode into your Java application to obtain the barcode recognition quality in percent.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.BarCode for Java provides a seamless solution for improving barcode recognition quality. By following this tutorial, you've learned how to implement this feature step by step, ensuring accurate and efficient barcode recognition in your Java application.
