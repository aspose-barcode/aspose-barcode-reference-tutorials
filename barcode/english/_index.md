# Create Codabar Barcode with Aspose.Barcode – Generator & Reader API

Are you ready to **create codabar barcode** solutions with Aspose.Barcode for .NET? In this tutorial we’ll walk through everything you need to know to **generate barcode .NET** applications, customize settings, and understand how the same library works for **read barcode java** scenarios. Whether you’re building a retail checkout system or a logistics tracking tool, mastering the **asp barcode generator** and **asp barcode reader** will give you full control over your barcode workflows.

## Quick Answers
- **What can I create?** Codabar, PDF417, QR, DataMatrix and many other symbologies.  
- **Which platforms are supported?** .NET (Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5/6) and Java.  
- **Do I need a license?** A free trial is available; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **How fast is barcode generation?** Milliseconds per image on typical hardware.  
- **Can I customize PDF417 settings?** Yes – use the **configure pdf417 barcode** options in the API.

## How to create codabar barcode using Aspose.Barcode
Aspose.Barcode provides a straightforward API to **create codabar barcode** images. The process involves initializing the `BarcodeGenerator`, selecting the `Codabar` symbology, setting the code text, and saving the result. This same approach works for other symbologies, letting you **generate barcode .NET** solutions with minimal code.

Below you’ll find a concise overview of the steps (full code examples are available in the linked tutorials):

1. **Instantiate the generator** – choose the Codabar symbology.  
2. **Set the code text** – include start/stop characters as required by Codabar.  
3. **Adjust optional parameters** – such as checksum, bar height, or font.  
4. **Save the barcode** – as PNG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF.

> **Pro tip:** When you need to **configure pdf417 barcode** parameters (e.g., error correction level or rows/columns), the same `BarcodeGenerator` class offers dedicated properties under `Pdf417EncodeMode`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use Aspose.Barcode to both generate and read barcodes in the same project?**  
A: Yes. The library includes both **asp barcode generator** and **asp barcode reader** classes, so you can create and decode barcodes without switching libraries.

**Q: How do I **read barcode java** code examples?**  
A: Check the Java tutorial section above – the “Document Barcode Recognition” guide shows how to load an image or PDF and extract barcode data using the `BarCodeReader` class.

**Q: What is the best way to **configure pdf417 barcode** for high‑density data?**  
A: Use the `Pdf417EncodeMode` and set properties such as `Rows`, `Columns`, and `ErrorCorrectionLevel`. The “Compact PDF417 Encoding” tutorial walks through these settings.

**Q: Do I need a separate license for .NET and Java?**  
A: A single Aspose.Barcode license file works across all supported platforms, including .NET and Java.

**Q: Is there support for checksum validation in Codabar?**  
A: Absolutely. The “Codabar Encoding and Checksum” guide explains how to enable checksum calculation when generating Codabar barcodes.
