# Mastering Aztec Symbol Mode with Aspose.BarCode for .NET

If you're looking to incorporate powerful barcode generation capabilities into your .NET applications, Aspose.BarCode for .NET is a fantastic solution. In this tutorial, we will delve into the Aztec Symbol Mode and explore its various options using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. We'll cover the prerequisites, import namespaces, and break down each example into multiple steps to guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of .NET development.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- A copy of Aspose.BarCode for .NET. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).

Now that you're all set, let's dive into the Aztec Symbol Mode examples.

## Importing Namespaces

First, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.BarCode for .NET. Open your Visual Studio project and add the following using statements at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
```

With the namespaces in place, you can now start using Aspose.BarCode for .NET.

## Step 1: Setting up the Barcode Generator

Begin by initializing the Barcode Generator with the Aztec encoding type and providing the code text. Here's how to do it:

```csharp
string path = "Your Directory Path";
System.Console.WriteLine("AztecSymbolModeExample:");

BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Aztec, "Åspóse.Barcóde©");
```

In this step, we have set up the generator and provided the code text for encoding.

## Step 2: Setting the Symbol Mode to Auto

Now, let's set the Aztec Symbol Mode to "Auto" and save the barcode image as a PNG file. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Aztec.AztecSymbolMode = AztecSymbolMode.Auto;
gen.Save($"{path}AztecSymbolModeAuto.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

This step ensures that the Aztec Symbol Mode is automatically determined, and the resulting barcode image is saved.

## Step 3: Setting the Symbol Mode to FullRange

If you want to specify the Aztec Symbol Mode as "FullRange," you can do so with the following code:

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Aztec.AztecSymbolMode = AztecSymbolMode.FullRange;
gen.Save($"{path}AztecSymbolModeFullRange.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

This will create a barcode with the FullRange Aztec Symbol Mode.

## Step 4: Setting the Symbol Mode to Compact

To create a barcode with the Aztec Symbol Mode set to "Compact," use the following code:

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Aztec.AztecSymbolMode = AztecSymbolMode.Compact;
gen.Save($"{path}AztecSymbolModeCompact.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

This step configures the barcode to be generated with the Compact Aztec Symbol Mode.

## Step 5: Setting the Symbol Mode to Rune

Finally, if you want to use the "Rune" Aztec Symbol Mode, you can do so by setting it as follows:

```csharp
gen.CodeText = "123"; // Change the code text if needed
gen.Parameters.Barcode.Aztec.AztecSymbolMode = AztecSymbolMode.Rune;
gen.Save($"{path}AztecSymbolModeRune.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

This step changes the code text to "123" and generates a barcode with the Rune Aztec Symbol Mode.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the Aztec Symbol Mode in Aspose.BarCode for .NET. We covered setting up the Barcode Generator, configuring the Aztec Symbol Mode as Auto, FullRange, Compact, and Rune, and saving the generated barcode images. With this knowledge, you can now incorporate versatile barcode generation into your .NET applications with ease.
