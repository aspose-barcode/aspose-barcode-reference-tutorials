# One-Dimensional Code 128 Configuration


If you're a .NET developer looking for a powerful tool to generate barcodes in your applications, Aspose.BarCode for .NET is your go-to solution. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of harnessing the capabilities of Aspose.BarCode for .NET to create one-dimensional Code 128 barcodes, and it's designed for both beginners and experienced developers. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting world of barcode generation with Aspose.BarCode, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.

2. Aspose.BarCode for .NET: You'll need to download and install Aspose.BarCode for .NET. You can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).

3. Your .NET Project: You should have a .NET project set up and ready to integrate barcode generation.

Now, let's get started!

## Import Namespaces

The first step is to import the necessary namespaces for your project. These namespaces will provide you with access to the features and functions of Aspose.BarCode.

### Step 1: Import the Namespaces

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
```

## One-Dimensional Code 128 Configuration

Now, let's create Code 128 barcodes using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. We'll go through each step in detail, ensuring that you have a clear understanding of the process.

### Step 2: Set the Path

First, set the path to the directory where you want to save the generated barcode images.

```csharp
string path = "Your Directory Path";
```

### Step 3: Create a Code 128 Barcode Generator

Create a `BarcodeGenerator` instance for generating Code 128 barcodes. You can specify the type of barcode you want to generate (in this case, Code128) and the value you want to encode.

```csharp
BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code128, "CODE");
```

### Step 4: Configure Barcode Parameters

Before generating the barcode, you can configure various parameters. For example, you can choose to show or hide the checksum.

#### Option 1: Do not show checksum

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ChecksumAlwaysShow = false;
```

#### Option 2: Show checksum

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.ChecksumAlwaysShow = true;
```

### Step 5: Save the Barcode Image

Now, it's time to save the generated barcode image to your specified directory. You can save the barcode with or without the checksum, depending on the configuration you chose in the previous step.

#### Save barcode without checksum

```csharp
gen.Save($"{path}OneCSCode128NotShowChecksum.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

#### Save barcode with checksum

```csharp
gen.Save($"{path}OneCSCode128ShowChecksum.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

That's it! You've successfully generated one-dimensional Code 128 barcodes using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. You can use these barcodes in various applications, such as inventory management, product labeling, and more.
