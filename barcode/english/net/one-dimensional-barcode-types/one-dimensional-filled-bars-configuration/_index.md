# One-Dimensional Filled Bars Configuration


Are you looking to generate professional and customizable barcodes in your .NET applications? Look no further! Aspose.BarCode for .NET is here to streamline your barcode creation process, offering a multitude of features and customization options to meet your specific needs. In this comprehensive tutorial, we will walk you through the basics of using Aspose.BarCode for .NET, from importing namespaces to generating one-dimensional filled bars. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of barcode generation with Aspose.BarCode for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: You need a working installation of Visual Studio to write and run your .NET applications.

2. Aspose.BarCode for .NET: Download and install Aspose.BarCode for .NET from the website. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).

3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the appropriate .NET Framework installed on your development machine.

Now that you have the prerequisites covered, let's move on to the exciting part.

## Importing Namespaces

To start using Aspose.BarCode for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Your Project
   Open your Visual Studio project where you plan to integrate barcode generation.

### Step 2: Import Namespaces
   In your code file, add the following using directives at the top:

   ```csharp
   using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
   ```

   This will allow you to access the BarcodeGenerator class and other relevant components.

With the namespaces in place, you're ready to create stunning barcodes with Aspose.BarCode for .NET!

## Generating One-Dimensional Filled Bars

In this section, we will demonstrate how to create one-dimensional barcodes with filled and empty bars using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
   Ensure you have a directory path where you want to save your barcode images. Replace `"Your Directory Path"` with your desired directory path.

   ```csharp
   string path = "Your Directory Path";
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize Barcode Generator
   Create a BarcodeGenerator object with the desired barcode type (in this case, Code128) and data ("ASPOSE").

   ```csharp
   BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code128, "ASPOSE");
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Filled Bars
   Set the XDimension in pixels and specify whether you want filled bars. For filled bars, set it to `true`, and for empty bars, set it to `false`.

   ```csharp
   gen.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Pixels = 2;
   gen.Parameters.Barcode.FilledBars = true;
   ```

### Step 4: Generate and Save Barcodes
   Generate and save the barcodes in your specified directory with the appropriate file format (in this case, PNG).

   ```csharp
   gen.Save($"{path}BarsFilledCode128.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
   gen.Parameters.Barcode.FilledBars = false;
   gen.Save($"{path}BarsEmptyCode128.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
   ```

With these simple steps, you can generate one-dimensional barcodes with either filled or empty bars using Aspose.BarCode for .NET.
