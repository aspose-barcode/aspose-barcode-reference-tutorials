# One-Dimensional Databar Row and Column Configuration


In today's digital world, barcodes play a crucial role in various industries, from inventory management to product labeling. As a developer, you might need a powerful tool to generate and customize barcodes in your .NET applications. Aspose.BarCode for .NET is a versatile library that enables you to create, customize, and manipulate one-dimensional and two-dimensional barcodes with ease.

In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of creating dynamic one-dimensional DataBar barcodes with row and column configuration using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. We will start by setting up the prerequisites, importing necessary namespaces, and then break down each example into multiple steps. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to generate custom DataBar barcodes tailored to your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into creating dynamic barcodes, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. .NET Development Environment

You should have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. This includes Visual Studio or any other suitable IDE for .NET development.

### 2. Aspose.BarCode for .NET

Ensure you have the Aspose.BarCode for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/barcode/net/).

### 3. License

You will need a valid license to use Aspose.BarCode for .NET in your applications. You can obtain a license or a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

## Importing Namespaces

To get started with Aspose.BarCode for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces provide access to the barcode generation features. Follow these steps to import the required namespaces:

### Step 1: Import Aspose.BarCode Namespace

Add the following code at the beginning of your .NET project to import the Aspose.BarCode namespace:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode;
```

Now, let's dive into creating dynamic one-dimensional DataBar barcodes with row and column configuration. We will demonstrate how to set the number of columns and rows to customize your barcode. This is a common requirement when generating barcodes for specific use cases.

## Step 2: Setting the Number of Columns

To create a DataBar barcode with a specific number of columns, follow these steps:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string path = "Your Directory Path";
System.Console.WriteLine("OneDDatabarRowCol:");

// Set 4 columns
BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DatabarExpandedStacked, "Databar Expanded Stacked long");
gen.Parameters.Barcode.DataBar.Columns = 4;
gen.Save($"{path}DatabarCols4.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

In this code snippet, we initialize a `BarcodeGenerator` with the desired barcode type and a caption. We then set the number of columns to 4 and save the generated barcode image to the specified path.

## Step 3: Setting the Number of Rows

To create a DataBar barcode with a specific number of rows, follow these steps:

```csharp
// Set 3 rows
gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DatabarExpandedStacked, "Databar Expanded Stacked long");
gen.Parameters.Barcode.DataBar.Rows = 3;
gen.Save($"{path}DatabarRows3.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

Here, we reinitialize the `BarcodeGenerator` and set the number of rows to 3. The barcode image is saved with the specified path.

## Step 4: Configuring Columns and Rows

You can also configure both the number of columns and rows in a DataBar barcode:

```csharp
// Set 6 columns and 10 rows
gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DatabarExpandedStacked, "Databar Expanded Stacked long");
gen.Parameters.Barcode.DataBar.Columns = 6;
gen.Parameters.Barcode.DataBar.Rows = 10;
gen.Save($"{path}DatabarCols6Rows10.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

In this step, we set both the number of columns and rows to create a customized DataBar barcode.

## Conclusion

Aspose.BarCode for .NET empowers developers to create dynamic and customizable barcodes for a wide range of applications. In this tutorial, we focused on one-dimensional DataBar barcodes with row and column configuration, demonstrating how to set up your development environment, import the necessary namespaces, and create custom barcodes tailored to your specific requirements.
