# Creating One-Dimensional Code 93 Barcodes


## Introduction

In today's digital age, barcodes have become an integral part of our lives, simplifying various processes like inventory management, product labeling, and more. Aspose.BarCode for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to generate and work with barcodes in their applications effortlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to create one-dimensional Code 93 barcodes using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial will walk you through the process in a user-friendly manner. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites:

Before we dive into creating Code 93 barcodes, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system. You can download it from the website.
2. Aspose.BarCode for .NET: You should have Aspose.BarCode for .NET installed. You can download it from the website.
3. Basic knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial.

Now that you have the necessary prerequisites, we can move on to the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces:

First, we need to import the required namespaces to use Aspose.BarCode for .NET effectively. This will enable us to access the library's functionality in our code. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.BarCode;
using Aspose.BarCode.Generation;
```

## Step 1: Set the Directory Path

Before we create the Code 93 barcode, we should specify the directory where we want to save the generated barcode images. Replace "Your Directory Path" with the path to your desired directory.

```csharp
string path = "Your Directory Path";
```

## Step 2: Create a One-Dimensional Code 93 Barcode

Now, let's create a one-dimensional Code 93 barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET. We'll configure the barcode with specific parameters.

```csharp
BarcodeGenerator gen = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.Code93Extended, "CODE");
```

In the code above, we're initializing a BarcodeGenerator object with the barcode type set to "Code93Extended" and the data we want to encode as "CODE."

## Step 3: Enable Checksum

By default, Code 93 barcodes include a checksum value for data integrity. You can enable or disable this feature as per your requirements. In this example, we enable the checksum.

```csharp
gen.Parameters.Barcode.IsChecksumEnabled = EnableChecksum.Yes;
```

## Step 4: Save the Barcode Image

Now that we've configured the barcode, it's time to generate and save it as an image in the specified directory. In this case, we're saving it as a PNG image.

```csharp
gen.Save($"{path}OneCSCode93WithChecksum.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```

## Step 5: Handling Exceptions

In some situations, you may want to generate a Code 93 barcode without a checksum. In such cases, you need to handle exceptions. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
try
{
    gen.Parameters.Barcode.IsChecksumEnabled = EnableChecksum.No;
    gen.GenerateBarCodeImage();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

In the code above, we attempt to generate a barcode without a checksum. If an exception occurs, we catch it and display an error message.

Now that we've walked through each step of creating a one-dimensional Code 93 barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET, you have a basic understanding of the process. Remember to adapt these steps to your specific use case.

In conclusion, Aspose.BarCode for .NET simplifies the generation of barcodes in your applications. With the ability to customize parameters, you can create barcodes that meet your exact needs. So, why not give it a try and streamline your barcode-related tasks with ease?
